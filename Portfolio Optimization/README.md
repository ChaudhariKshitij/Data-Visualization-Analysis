# Portfolio Optimization with Python 📈

## Overview 🌐

This repository contains Python code for optimizing an investment portfolio using historical stock data. The portfolio optimization process involves analyzing historical returns, calculating risk and return metrics, and utilizing the PyPortfolioOpt library for efficient portfolio allocation.

## Key Features 🚀

### 1. Historical Data Collection 📊

The code fetches historical adjusted close prices for a specified portfolio of stocks using the Yahoo Finance API. The selected assets and their corresponding weights are defined in the script.

### 2. Visualization 📈

The script generates a plot showcasing the adjusted close prices of each stock in the portfolio over time. This visualization provides an overview of the historical performance of the selected assets.

### 3. Risk and Return Metrics 🔄

The code calculates key portfolio metrics, including daily returns, annual covariance matrix, portfolio variance, portfolio volatility, and annualized portfolio return. These metrics serve as crucial indicators for assessing the risk and return profile of the investment portfolio.

### 4. Efficient Portfolio Optimization 🛠️

The PyPortfolioOpt library is employed for efficient portfolio optimization. The code constructs an Efficient Frontier and optimizes the portfolio for maximum Sharpe ratio, providing a set of optimal weights for each asset.

### 5. Discrete Allocation of Funds 💵

To facilitate practical implementation, the script performs discrete allocation of funds based on the optimized weights. This step provides insights into how to allocate funds across the selected assets to achieve the optimal risk-adjusted returns.
